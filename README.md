# SwipeAssignment
This is an Android application developed using the latest technologies and design patterns. The app fetches data from an API using Retrofit and OkHttp3, and displays it in a RecyclerView using LiveData and ViewModel. It uses Coroutines for asynchronous programming and ViewBinding for view binding. It also incorporates Dependency Injection using Hilt and follows Material Design guidelines.
It also have animations in the recycler view and shimmer effect while the data is loading.
## Technologies
### [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
Kotlin is a modern programming language that is used for developing Android applications. It is a statically typed language that supports functional programming concepts, and is interoperable with Java.

### [XML](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/declaring-layout)
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used for designing the layout of Android UI. It is a markup language that allows developers to define custom tags and attributes.

### [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
Coroutines is a concurrency framework for Kotlin that enables asynchronous programming. It provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easy to understand and maintain.

### [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
LiveData is a data holder class that is lifecycle-aware. It allows data to be observed and updated only when there are active observers, which helps to prevent memory leaks and improves app performance.

### [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
ViewModel is an Android architecture component that is used to store and manage UI-related data. It is designed to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations, and provides a way to share data between fragments and activities.

### [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)
ViewBinding is a feature that was introduced in Android Studio 4.0. It generates a binding class for each XML layout file that is used in the app, allowing developers to access the views directly without using findViewById().

### [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that was introduced by Google. It provides a way to simplify the process of dependency injection by generating code for common Android classes such as Activities and Fragments.

### [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
Retrofit2 is a REST client for Android and Java that is used to make HTTP requests to a web server. It is built on top of OkHttp3 and allows developers to define a REST API interface using annotations.

### [OkHttp3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
OkHttp3 is an HTTP client that is used to make HTTP requests in Android applications. It provides a way to perform asynchronous network calls and supports HTTP/2 and WebSockets.

### [Material Design](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
Material Design is a design language that was introduced by Google. It provides a set of guidelines for designing Android applications, and includes a set of UI components and patterns that can be used to create consistent and intuitive user interfaces.

### Usage
To use this app, simply clone the repository and open it in Android Studio. The app can be run on an Android device or emulator.
